The Zen Garden Challenge

Setup

Run the following command in your terminal:

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/the-static-web/zen-garden && cd $_
This will create a project folder and cd you into it.
Create a new GitHub repository.
Once your repository is created, copy the list of commands under "..or create a new repository on the command line" by clicking on the clipboard icon.
Paste the commands into your terminal. This will create a README.md file, add it, commit it, connect your local repo to GitHub, and set you up to push up the changes. (If the last command, git push origin master isn't automatically executed, hit enter/return to run it).
All of your work should be on a branch, NOT on master. To do this, type:

git checkout -b exercise
touch index.html
touch style.css
mkdir images
You are now ready to work in the exercise branch.
Requirements

Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden.

Download the HTML and CSS files.
üìé HTML
üìé CSS

Copy the contents of the HTML file into your index.html.
Copy the contents of the CSS file into your styles.css.

The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.
When your work is complete, add, commit, and push up the branch (git push origin exercise). Then submit a pull request on Github.
